# Virtual Piano Application

## Introduction

Before we start this app, we must first understand some basics behind music theory and what rules apply to a musical keyboard. For this application, we will apply MIDI Notes Numbers for that.

Notes in an octave start from C and go up to B like this:

C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B

Sharp (#) is a sign which tells us that a given note is "sharp." There are also "flat" notes, but for simplicities sake we will focus on and use sharps. Sharp note is a note that is half a step higher than its natural note and half a step lower than the next note. So that A# is half a tone higher than A and half a tone lower than B.

On a musical keyboard, they would be positioned like this. White keys are naturals and black keys are sharp.
